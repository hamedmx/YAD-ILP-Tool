######### Sample data guidelines for Ontology Matching Task Using YAD ILP Tool #########

# == Comment or Description

### All the required information including using and citing this ILP tool has been 
### described in both the related paper published by JOSS and README file in its 
### GitHub repository.


##### Example for Two Anatomy Ontologies: Human (NCI_C) and Adult Mouse (MA_) #####
### Preparing a single data file to be uploaded to the ILP tool.
 
### A part of Human Anatomy Ontology in OWL format:

<owl:Class rdf:about="Human.owl#NCI_C12234">
	<rdfs:label rdf:datatype="XMLSchema#string">
		sublingual salivary gland
	</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="Human.owl#NCI_C12999"/>
	<oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym rdf:resource="Human.owl#genid4893"/>
	<oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym rdf:resource="Human.owl#genid4894"/>
</owl:Class>

### A part of Adult Mouse Anatomy Ontology in OWL format:

<owl:Class rdf:about="Mouse.owl#MA_0001588">
	<rdfs:label rdf:datatype="XMLSchema#string">
		sublingual gland
	</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="Mouse.owl#MA_0002478"/>
</owl:Class>

### This aforementioned information in each ontology OWL file can constitute our Background Knowledge, 
### positive, and negative examples in a single file (here, for ontology matching task).
### These ontologies' concepts (OWL format) can be transformed to first-order logical rules 
### (all with lower-case letters) as follows:

### Adding 'B' with a single white space after at the first of each rule, regarding the particular 
### syntax for the ILP tool.

B label(nci_c12234,sublingual salivary gland)
B subclassof(nci_c12234,nci_c12999)
B relatedsynonym(nci_c12234,genid4893)
B relatedsynonym(nci_c12234,genid4894)

B label(ma_0001588,sublingual gland)
B subclassof(ma_0001588,ma_0002478)

### Adding more information to the file as Background Knowledge in aforementioned format, if exists.
### (like logical rules extracted by various similarity measures)

### Then, adding positive examples to the file (reference alignments from RDF file of manual alignments):

### A part of reference alignment (manual alignments) file in RDF format:

<map>
	<Cell>
		<entity1 rdf:resource="http://mouse.owl#MA_0001588"/>
		<entity2 rdf:resource="http://human.owl#NCI_C12234"/>
		<measure rdf:datatype="xsd:float">1.0</measure>
		<relation>=</relation>
	</Cell>
</map>

### Adding '+' with a single white space after at the first of each rule, regarding the particular 
### syntax for the ILP tool.

+ align(nci_c12234,ma_0001588)

### Then, adding negative examples to the file as much as it is needed regarding the use case and 
### application (here, any rule that does not exist in reference alignments from RDF file of  
### manual alignments considered as negative example, and empirically, the double of the number 
### of positive examples is adequate):

### Adding '-' with a single white space after at the first of each rule, regarding the particular 
### syntax for the ILP tool.

- align(nci_c12234,ma_0001498)
- align(nci_c12346,ma_0001588)
- align(nci_c11256,ma_0000987)
- align(nci_c13453,ma_0001236)

### All the generated rules (background knowledge, positive, and negative examples) are gathered 
### together with their particular formats in a single file to be uploaded to the ILP tool.
